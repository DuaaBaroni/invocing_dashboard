## invoicing_responsive_dashboard
 The main goal of creating this dashboard is how to make the app or the web responsive .
 ## The widgets used to make it responsive:-
  - MediaQuery to adjust height and width.
  - FittedBox
  - Expanded Widget
  - Flexiable
  - LayoutBuilder to determine constraints of width to know the platform used.
  - AspectRatio
  - Responsive Text
  
## I worked on organizing and clean code to be reusable and maintainable
